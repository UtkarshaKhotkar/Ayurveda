            <h2>Questions about Ayurveda</h2>
            <h3>1.What are ayurvedic treatments?<br>
                -There are many treatments in the Ayurvedic toolbox for rebalancing health. They include:<br>
                
                -Lifestyle changes like going to bed at a regular time<br>
                -Diet changes like eating more warm foods or oils or greens<br>
                -Herbs – in many forms, loose powder, capsules, teas, medicated ghee/oil, tinctures, honey balls.<br>
                -Body treatments<br>
                -PanchaKarma – deep cleansing and rejuvenation process<br>
                -Yoga, Meditation<br>
                -Aromatherapy, Color Therapy<br><br>
            
                2.Does Ayurvedic medicine have side effects?<br>
There can be a detox effect which can take the form of mild flu-like symptoms, or a rash. This usually is a normal 
reaction and means that the herbs are doing their job. Sometimes the reaction can be stronger and usually the practitioner
 makes an adjustment in the dosing.<br><br>

                3.Where does Ayurvedic medicine come from?<br>
Nature! Ayurveda remedies are all based on the concept that you can eat your therapies. That is why there is such an
 emphasis on making sure that the herbs, oils, and other substances come from clean sources so that we don’t create 
 more toxins in the body.<br><br>

                4.Why is Ayurveda important?<br>
                Ayurveda treats the root cause of disease and allopathic methods treat symptoms. Ayurveda goes after the
                 root cause which will have a more longstanding effect.<br>
                
                Ayurveda allows you to take the reins of your own health. You don’t have to wait for a prescription or undergo
                 unnecessary tests. For example, if you normally have a pattern of getting a little constipated in fall, then 
                 prior to fall you would start eating more warm cooked moderately spiced foods, ingest more healthy oils, take
                  in more water and warm herbal teas, return to a more regular routine, avoid cold & drying foods.<br><br>

                  5.How do you drink ghee in the morning?<br>
                  You add hot water to melt the ghee and then drink it on an empty stomach. You don’t eat until you are
                   genuinely hungry later that day.<br>
                  <br>
                  6.How do you do Basti at home?<br>
                  You lie on the bathroom floor on your left side, insert the enema tubing or bottle filled with medicated 
                  oil or tea, and then hold it for as long as you can. Once you get the urge to defecate, you will then use 
                  the toilet to release the oil or tea.  You then wear pad or disposable underpants overnight to catch any 
                  leaking oil or tea.  You are fine to wear your normal undergarments the next morning.<br><br>

                  7.Do you lose weight with Panchakarma?<br>
                  Most people lose weight on a panchakarma. It varies greatly depending on what was in the diet prior to the
                   PK. PK primes the body for more significant weight loss especially if you stay with a simple diet for a 
                   longer period of time.<br>
