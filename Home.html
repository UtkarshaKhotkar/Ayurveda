            <h1>Ayurveda</h1>
            <h3>Ayurveda (a Sanskrit word that means "science of life" or "knowledge of life") is one of the world's oldest 
                whole-body healing systems. It was developed more than 5,000 years ago in India.

                Ayurveda is based on the belief that health and wellness depend on a delicate balance between the mind, body,
                 spirit, and environment. The main goal of ayurvedic medicine is to promote
                 good health and prevent, not fight, disease. But treatments may be geared toward specific health problems.
                 Ayurveda and Your Life Energy.
                 <br>
                 Ayurveda is based on the theory that everything in the universe dead or alive is connected. If your mind, 
                 body, and spirit are in harmony with the universe, you have good health. When something disrupts this balance,
                  you get sick. Among the things that can upset this balance are genetic or birth defects, injuries, climate and
                   seasonal change, age, and your emotions.
                 <br>
                 Those who practice ayurveda believe every person is made of five basic elements found in the universe: space, air,
                  fire, water, and earth.
                 
                 These combine in the human body to form three life forces, or energies, called doshas. They control how your body 
                 works. They are vata dosha (space and air); pitta dosha (fire and water); and kapha dosha (water and earth).
                 <br>

                 <h3> Herbs and spices play an important part in a holistic approach to health and wellness. Ayurveda is a 
                    traditional medicine system from India that focuses on promoting wellness of body, mind, and spirit. The holistic
                     approach combines lifestyle changes, diet, and exercise.

                    Ayurvedic herbs and spices play an important role in the overall system of Ayurvedic medicine. Followers of
                     Ayurveda state that the medications offer protection from disease, help with mental health, and aid digestion.</h3>

                     <h3>The ayurvedic herb is an integral part of the ayurvedic medicine system. From ancient times, we are using these
                         herbs to treat different diseases, to promote mental clarity, boost immunity, healthy skin, hair, etc. In 
                         Ayurveda, a patient can be treated as a whole and not just a diseased part. Thousands of herbs have been used
                          in Ayurveda to treat illnesses where active ingredients are derived from leaves, roots, flowers, bark. Herbs
                           are potent to balance the level in mind and body.  </h3>
